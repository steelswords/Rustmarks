# Rustmarks

Rustmarks is a webserver to host my portfolio site, eventually. It is written in
Rust and serves content pages written in Markdown quickly and efficiently. Another
Rust Markdown CMS, if it can even be called that.

# Why I Made This

For some reason, I just can't let it go, letting my website [tristanandrus.com](https://tristanandrus.com) run
on someone else's code. Wordpress is fine, it just keeps coming up. It would be
so much more *efficient* if I wrote my own webserver that serves this website from
Markdown, yes? Right? Guys?

In other words, I would call this a self-serving project, except I'm not sure exactly
what purpose it serves in the first place. More customizability than I'm interested to learn
with Wordpress? The satisfaction of knowing that *I wrote that*? Another oportunity
to stretch my Rust wings? None of these reasons are particularly compelling, but still
I can't help finding myself drawn to this stupid project. So here we are.
